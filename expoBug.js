While using Expo CLI, I encountered an issue where the `expo start` command would fail to launch the development server with a cryptic error message.  The error message didn't provide much information, and the standard troubleshooting steps (like checking the network connection or reinstalling Expo CLI) didn't resolve the problem.  The error logs showed something like: `Error: Something went wrong while building.  Please check your project configuration.`  This problem seems to occur randomly and without any specific pattern.
