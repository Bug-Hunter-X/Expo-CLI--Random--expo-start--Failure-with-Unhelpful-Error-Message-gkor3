# Expo CLI Random `expo start` Failure

This repository demonstrates a bug in Expo CLI where the `expo start` command fails randomly with a vague error message. The error message itself doesn't provide useful debugging information, and typical troubleshooting techniques do not fix the issue.

## Reproducing the Bug

The exact steps to reproduce this bug are not consistently clear, as it appears to be random. However, the `expoBug.js` file contains a minimal Expo project setup.  Attempting to start this project with `expo start` might, but isn't guaranteed to, reproduce the error. 

## Solution

The `expoBugSolution.js` file includes a potential solution involving a combination of clearing the Expo cache, deleting the `.expo` folder and `node_modules`, and reinstalling dependencies. While this isn't guaranteed to work in all cases (as the root cause remains somewhat elusive), it has shown promise in resolving the issue in some instances.   Further investigation into Expo CLI's internals might be necessary to pinpoint the exact underlying cause.
